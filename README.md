# Support-Vector-Machine-Implementation
[Theoretical Foundations of ML]
## Support Vector Machine Project:</br>
Implementing the support vector machine algorithm that performs the following tasks:
1. Train and classify for linearly separable case.
2. Train and classify for the non-separable case. 
3. Train and classify for non-linearly separable case. [Using Kernels]

In each of the previous three cases:</br>
* Find optimal alphas.
* Calculate W & b .
* Formulate the classifier Function.
* Draw the decision boundary.
* Use an appropriate dataset for each case.

4. Performs analysis based on the VC-dimensional and generalizationÂ error.
